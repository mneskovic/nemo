Jerry Sellwood's new GALAXY (V1.5) version should be placed in the
GALAXY15 directory.

See http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/galaxy how to download this.

Instaling via the command
	mknemo galaxy15
but note this will overwrite the old (v1.3) galaxy executable in $NEMOBIN

You may also need to tinker with some variables as suggested in
$NEMO/src/scripts/mknemo.d/galaxy15 if the default compilation fails.

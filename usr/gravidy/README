As for install, the 'cpu' version is the easiest to install, although
also the slowest.  It just needs the BOOST library, which in Ubuntu
is a simple
     sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev


Example install from scratch: (version is 1.70.1 here, may be newer)

   set vu=1_70_0
   set vd=`echo $vu | sed s/_/./g`

   wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/$vd/source/boost_${vu}.tar.gz
   tar zxf boost_${vu}.tar.gz
   cd boost_${vu}
   ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$NEMO/opt
   time ./b2

The last command will compile and install in $NEMO/opt/, and can take a while
(~15 mins)

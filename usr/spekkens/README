The programs velfit and diskfit are publicly available.
See man pages for runvelfitss07 and rundiskfit

The mknemo build script knows about them.

Private version for NEMO (slightly enhanced with a Makefile.NEMO
and the NUMREC directory) can be obtained via NEMO.

Examples to obtain velfit:

cvs -d /home/cvsroot co -r VERSION velfit
where version is one of:

    V1_0  (oct 2008)
    V1_1  (aug 2009)
    V2_0  (jan 2010)

Notice that the manual, velfit.pdf, is also adjusted within each revision.


Same for diskfit:

cvs -d /home/cvsroot co -r VERSION diskfit

with tags:

    V1_0   (sep 2012)
    V1_1   (mar 2013)

* active issues are now moved to https://github.com/teuben/nemo/issues
* Some TODO's also here:   https://github.com/teuben/nemo/projects/1


* this is the TODO list for the 4.2 release

- default configure gives yapp.ps, but should check if pgplot is natively there
- is rman partially broken on U18?
       PolyglotMan v3.2 of $Date: 2003/07/26 19:00:48 $
- is there rman -> rst ?
- more solid examples of openmp








* Below here old stuff - some are still relevant


- gcc3:  when using c++ NEMO's "string" will now collide with the 
         default C++ type 'string'....

	 -DSINGLEPREC does not work for a number of programs due to
	bad prototyping of the "proc" functions. This will be fixed,
	and is also needed in preparation for NEMO V5 when a C++ compiler
	will be the default compiler. 

- large objects (> 2GB or > 4GB), specifically snapshots, can be limited
  in size of they use private calls to allocate() without making sure the
  argument has been casted to (size_t)

- filestruct:
  The following snippet of code stores only  "1" for the value of pi,
  3 times. ZENO actually does it correct.
    put_set(ostr,"par");
    pi = 1;
    put_data(ostr, "pi", DoubleType, &pi, 0);
    pi = 2;
    put_data(ostr, "pi", DoubleType, &pi, 0);
    pi = 3;
    put_data(ostr, "pi", DoubleType, &pi, 0);
    put_tes(ostr,"par");
  ZENO also reads correctly, and if no more 'same name' items are present,
  it will repeat the last one read. But the ZENO reader will serially
  read (and remember?)

- filestruct history: long character strings are broken in silly places,
	and don't port very well between tsf/rsf

- comment from Walter:

  > I tried to make my own potential very much in the same way in which
  > plummer.c works, except that I added a routine "potential()", beside
  > "potential_double()" and "potential_float()", but identical to
  > "potential_double()". It appears that adding "potential()" creates a
  > segmentation fault (on returning from "potential_float()"). I don't know
  > why, do you?


- mktemp() should be converted mkstemp() in stropen.c (recent gcc compilers
  will complain about it, but it will work)
  Problem: can't get a fileno from a FILE * (the other way around
  is ok, use fileno()) so we're stuck....


- -DSINGLEPREC:  scfm does not work
 		 athan92 shows some significant force differences
		 testsuite nbody/init and nbody/evolve/flowcode have problems

? kawai/nbody does not seem to work, neither in IONEMO mode, nor default I/O mode
  (at least on linux)

- fie:  ifgt(%1,0,log(%1),-10) doesn't work,e.g. seems to work in nemoinp
  but not via ccdmath/tabmath, e.g.
   echo -10 | tabmath - - 'ifgt(%1,0,log(%1),%1)'

- x86_64:  our configure doesn't always seem to recognize /usr/X11R6/lib64 should be used
  instead of /usr/X11R6/lib ....
  Examples: gaia fails, diary ok:

- cfitsio: currently broken, seems to write huge files in e.g. ccdfits

- magalie: hangs on gcc 4.1.0 ?? but this is the same gcc 4.1.0 in which
	falcON mis-behaves, while on the laptop it's both ok.
	
- pgplot (or yapp_pgplot): if the sccreen aspect ratio is not the
  classic 4:3, the plot is not square

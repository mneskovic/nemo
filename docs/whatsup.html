<H1> What's Up in NEMO </H1>

Ideas.....and things we're working on

<HR>

<H2> Currently working on </H2>
<UL>
  <LI> python support
  <LI> omp support (-fopenmp)
  <LI> switch the default matrix definition from C based to Fortran based, to better match
    FITS I/O. There is a branch MATDEF (from CVS times) where this is developed.
<LI> moving from MAKE to CMAKE?   [jcl]  
<LI> code conversions:
  <UL>
  <LI> proper  prototype usage to aid compilation with -DSINGLEPREC and
 	using the g++ compiler instead of gcc compiler 
  <LI> Random I/O:
  <LI> Adding some new integrators: Sellwood's GALAXY, Aarseth's
	NBODY1 and NBODY2.
  <LI> although all -DSINGLEPREC is now supposed to work, some minor
      cleanup may be needed, in particular the proc's. Perhaps
      use new typedef's for prototyped versions. Sometimes one can
      get by with only a helper typedef in the actual code where
      the (*proc)() is called. [see e.g. contour.c]
  <LI> shared libraries. Works for linux, but formal installation
	not supported yet. The current install works for mac as well.
  <LI> A nearly completely rewritten command line user interface
	<A HREF=man_html/getparam.3.html> getparam(3NEMO) </A>
	Also fixed many small bugs. The main new features will be:
        <UL>
        <LI> new argv= system keyword. To allow hackers to bypass some
            of the restrictions os a static program keyword list. One
            obvious example is a resource list for X windows yapp
            drivers (although yapp= should be used for this primarely)
        <LI> keywords can be used in minimum matched mode, but a warning
            will be given for each minimum match that gets expanded.
        <LI> if keywords have not been used, and a debug level is given,
            the user will be warned about this.
        <LI> a tcl interface, although by default this is not compiled
        </UL>
  </UL>
<LI> Planned upgrades:
    <UL>
    <LI> automatic selection of yapp's during installation [done]
    <LI> default hdf support 
    <LI> add cmhog/hdfgrid support
    <LI> add some more potentials, e.g. athan92, piner94
    <LI> tcl/tk support for genscript's
    <LI> better mapsys support
    <LI> Sellwood's N-body integrator [done, but now there is galaxy15]
    <LI> add NEMOXLIB, NEMOXINC environment variables for X windows
    <LI> starlab support
    <LI> velfit support needs to include diskfit now
    </UL>
<LI> supplying <B> all </B> manual pages for the kernel routines
<LI> orbname, orbwood - orbit classification and spectral dynamics
<LI> snapfit - best fit 6D snapshot to a 3D data cube
<LI> yapp_x - generic X windows device  (Patrick Frisch' contribution)
<LI> nbody0, nbody1, nbody2, nbody5 - interfaces
<LI> snap interface (Luis Aguilar)
<LI> tabview - dynamic table queries
<LI> serial snapshot processing. This is primarely usefull for 'small'
    memory (slow?) machines where as snapshot is broken up in pieces
    (see e.g. <A HREF=man_html/snapsplit.3.html> snapsplit </A> or 
    <A HREF=man_html/mkspiral.1.html>mkspiral</A>) 
    and processed independantly. Useful
    for Monte-Carlo simulations.
<LI> WWW [now via github pages in $NEMO/docs]
</UL>

<H2> Considering work on  </H2>
<UL> 
<LI> yapp_generic - binds multiple yapp's into one (cf. yapp_pgplot),
	in particular for yapp_x and yapp_ps
<LI> tk interface ala Khoros/Cantata and Mirtool [abandoned]
<LI> using GNU make (gmake). This would (eventually) make it impossible
	to install NEMO without gmake. It would become part of the
	installation procedure. [note CMAKE query]
<LI> better image data-structure, e.g. allowing dynamic typing, and 
	better random access for big images/cubes.
<LI> support for non-homogenous snapshots (e.g. SPH, Tipsy "3S")
<LI> stripping kernel routines in favor of a more generic library, such
	as glib (part of <A HREF=http://www.gtk.org/>GTK+</A>).
</UL>

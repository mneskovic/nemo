<H1> A Fake Bar </H1>

Here is an examples of a script to make a fake composite disk galaxy
with  bulge, disk, halo, spiral arms and some noise.  The shell script
has reasonable defaults for everything, except no noise. The
accompanying figure was produced using version 0.1 of the script
<PRE>
    fakebar.csh an=1 hn=1

This picture actually has a bulge, bar, disk and of course spiral arms.
The disk is at INC=60 and PA=40, see if you can guess what PA the bar is?

You can download the latest <A HREF=fakebar.txt>fakebar.csh</A> from here, 
as well as the original <A HREF=fakebar.fits>fakebar.fits</A> file that
was produced with it. It mostly uses the
program <A HREF=../man_html/ccdgen.1.html>
ccdgen</A> in a pipe.

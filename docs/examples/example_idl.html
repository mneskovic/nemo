<B> *** under construction *** </B>
<p>

For those not used to IDL, probably the biggest syntax surprises are:
<OL>
<LI> variables are case insensitive, and space doesn't always matter
(remember good old Fortran-6 ?)
<LI> comments are preceded with an ; symbol
<LI> lines starting with ! are global variables, often used to set plotting
parameters. Example "!x.title = 'x (kpc)'"
</OL>

For those not used to python, probably the biggest syntax surprises are:
<OL>
<LI> indentation is important and control the if/then/else/etc flow
<LI> there's a clear namespace, e.g. you can have functions such as
math.sqrt() and numpy.sqrt() and normally you do this via the
"import math" and "import numpy" commands.
<LI> comments are preceded with #, but also sections between """ and """
</OL>

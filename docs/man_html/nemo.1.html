nemo, astronemo - outline the NEMO package 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Description</a></h2>
<b>nemo</b> is a computer
package, there is no program with that name. On linux there is also the
<i>nemo</i> file manager, which is a fork of <i>nautilus</i>. <p>
<b>astronemo</b> is the name you
may find in some package managers. If you google the name <i>nemo</i>, you will
find a lot of computer related tools with that name. <p>
<b>NEMO</b> is a <i>Stellar Dynamics
Toolbox</i> for users and programmers. It has various programs to create, integrate
and analyze N-body systems. In addition there are various tools to operate
on images, tables and orbits, including FITS files to export/import to/from
other astronomical data reduction packages. <p>
A good start is the manual page
<a href='programs.8.html'><i>programs(8NEMO)</i></a>
, which lists programs thematically, and <a href='index.1.html'><i>index(1NEMO)</i></a>
, which
lists them  alphabetically (CAVEAT: these pages are not well maintained).
<p>
<b>NEMO</b> is very much integrated into the Unix(tm) operating system, so users
are expected to use standard Unix commands as glue between the various
tasks (cat, ls, rm, cp, awk, sm, <i>etc.</i>). Understanding of shell scripting
(sh, csh, python, perl, <i>etc.</i>) can be very useful. Several example shell scripts
exist in the source tree to demonstrate how experiments can be orchestrated.
We use mostly csh, bash and python. Yes, csh too, even though csh is considered
harmful now.

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Getting Started</a></h2>
What you need to do to set yourself up for <b>NEMO</b>: <p>
The easiest
way is to add the appropriate line to your <i>.cshrc</i> or <i>.bashrc</i> file. For example
<br>
<pre>        source /opt/nemo/nemo_start.sh
<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;
or for the die hards
        source /opt/nemo/nemo_start.ssh
</pre><p>
If you need more control over your NEMO environment, there are other methods
described elsewhere (The <i>NEMO Users/Programmers Guide</i>, Appendix A), or
consult one of your local friendly NEMO users. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>How to Run Nemo Programs</a></h2>
NEMO
programs can be run just as any other command in Unix, in that sense NEMO
is nothing more than an extension of Unix. NEMO programs usually read and/or
write files, though these files can in most circumstances be replaced with
a dash to designate a unix pipe, e.g. <br>
<pre>     mkplummer - 10 | snapprint -
</pre><p>
NEMO programs all work by using a series of <i>keyword=value</i> pairs on the
commandline. If the order of the supplied keywords is the same as the program
expects them, the <i>keyword=</i> part can be omitted, simply to save some keystrokes.
 There is a consistent ordering of keywords in most programs that allows
experienced users to use such (and other) shortcuts. Python uses the same
principle with the un-named arguments. (e.g. <b>in=</b> the first one, <b>out=</b> the second
one etc.). Keywords can be used in minimum match, but this is not recommended
for shell scripts. To make shell scripts robust, it is recommended you add
the <i>keyword=</i> part for all but the first one or two. <p>
NEMO programs make a
distinction between <b>program</b> keywords (keywords unique to a program) and
<b>system</b>  keywords (a fixed set of keywords that each NEMO program understands).
 The system keywords that you are likely to use are <i> help=</i> and <i>yapp=</i>, and
to a lesser degree  <i>debug=</i> and <i>error=</i>.  The <i>help=</i> gives various types of
 inline aid from a program. There is also online help on a  program, for
which unix <a href='man.1.html'><i>man(1)</i></a>
 command (or any of it&rsquo;s derived friends) is normally used.
The <i>yapp=</i> sets the graphics device used by programs who use a graphics
device. Your <i>nemo_start</i> environment may have given you a default. <b>YAPP=/xs</b>
is a common default if the yapp_pgplot interface is used. <p>
Each <b>system</b> keyword
can be defaulted by setting it&rsquo;s equivalent environment variable (in upper
case!). Program keywords can be abbreviated to uniqueness. <p>
Examples: Consider
the program <i>mkplummer</i>, a program which creates an N-body realization of
a Plummer sphere. To get online help, one types (we included three legacy
program options, --man, --help, --version): <br>
<pre>        man mkplummer
        mkplummer --man
</pre>and to get various types of inline help: <br>
<pre>        mkplummer --help
        mkplummer -h<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;
        mkplummer help=
        mkplummer help=h
        mkplummer help=&rsquo;?&rsquo;
</pre>and to get the version: <br>
<pre>        mkplummer help=V
        mkplummer --version
</pre>Note the literal quotes around the question-mark needed if you use a regular
Unix shell as interface. The first <i>help=</i> reminds you of the order of the
program keywords and their default values. The second form, <i>help=h</i> prints
out a small one-line reminder what each keyword means. The last form <i>help=&rsquo;?&rsquo;</i>
lists various options the user interface understands, this one is not program
dependant. <p>
If you chain NEMO programs, pipes can be a very efficient way
to stream data and/or prevent large amounts of disk access. Most keywords
that operate  on files (notably <b>in=</b>, <b>out=</b>, as long as <a href='stropen.3.html'><i>stropen(3NEMO)</i></a>
 is
used) can use standard piped I/O by using the dash (<b>-</b>) to name the keyword,
e.g. <br>
<pre>    mkplummer - 10 | snapprint -
</pre>would create a snapshot of 10 bodies on the fly, and print positions and
velocities to the user using <b>snapprint</b>. The alternative would have been
<br>
<pre>    mkplummer out=tmp nbody=10
    snapprint in=tmp
    rm tmp
</pre>
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>HOW TO RUN non-NEMO PROGRAMS</a></h2>
Over the times NEMO has incoorporated a number
of non-NEMO programs, with varying degrees of input parameter schemes. Some
via parameter files, some interactive input, some a command line interface
alien to NEMO. For a number of them a unified NEMO frontend was developed,
usually those programs start with the prefix <b>run</b>. For example, <b>bulgerot</b>
comes with <b>runbulgerot</b>. Since often such programs have a hardcoded name
for input and/or output files, one simple way to be able to run  them in
parallel without stepping on filenames, is the use of a clean run directory.
 Example of this can be found in  <a href='runbulgerot.1.html'><i>runbulgerot(1NEMO)</i></a>
, <a href='runbody1.1.html'><i>runbody1(1NEMO)</i></a>
,
<a href='rungalaxy.1.html'><i>rungalaxy(1NEMO)</i></a>
, <a href='runscfm.1.html'><i>runscfm(1NEMO)</i></a>
, <a href='runqumond.1.html'><i>runqumond(1NEMO)</i></a>
, and some others. <p>
You
will find a few common user keywords for this: <b>outdir=</b> is always a required
keyword, and needs to be a non-existing directory in which the data is written.
For some programs there is an <b>exe=</b> keyword, in order to change the name
of the non-NEMO program to be run. This is always assumed to be in the standard
Unix search path ($PATH). <p>
Although these run* programs use a fairly common
method to run the non-NEMO programs, they have not all been unified as is
proposed in <a href='run.3.html'><i>run(3NEMO)</i></a>
. 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Programming</a></h2>
You may need to do some sherlocking here.
You have probably seen the configure.ac and makedefs file. The $NEMOLIB/makedefs
is the active file.  The <a href='mknemo.8.html'><i>mknemo(8NEMO)</i></a>
 will help you (re)compile programs,
though <a href='bake.8.html'><i>bake(8NEMO)</i></a>
 can do a better job in a local directory.

<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>Bugs</a></h2>
Since programs are being
modified, and extended fairly regularly,  manual pages for related programs
do not always know about these changes if they should. Keeping good cross
references in the manual pages might help. However, the <b>help=</b> description
should always be up to date, since it is derived from the code itself. <p>

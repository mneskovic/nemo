<H1> Using NEMO </H1>
<OL>

  <LI> <b> I get "command not found" for all NEMO commands </b>
    <br>

    There are two possible causes:
    <br>
    If <b>all</b> commands fails, for
    example <b>mkplummer</b>, the NEMO environment was not added to your shell.
    So  most likely you need to <b>source</b> the <b>nemo_start.sh</b> file,
    for example
    <pre>
      source /opt/nemo/nemo_start.sh
    </pre>
    If your case is a less common command, you <i>might</i> be able to install
    this on-the-fly with the <b>mknemo</b> command, for example
    <pre>
      mknemo mktt72
    </pre>
    would (re)compile the <b>mktt72</b> command
      
    <br>
    <br>
    
<LI> <b> Help, how do I get help </b>
<br>
Most NEMO programs have (standard unix) manual pages, but each program
can also describe itself using the help= system keyword. And there
is of course the web
<pre>
    % man programs
    % man index
    % man snapplot				(or whatever program)
    % ghostview $NEMO/text/manuals/nemo.ps
    % tsf help=					(or whatever program)
    % tsf help=\?				(or whatever program)
    % http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo
    % mailto:nemo@astro.umd.edu

<H1> Installing NEMO </H1>

<OL>
  <LI> <b> How do I install NEMO </b>
    <br>
  Of course there are many variations, but the following commands should get you
  something basic:
  <pre>
    git clone https://github.com/teuben/nemo
    cd nemo
    ./configure
    make build
    make check
    make bench
    source nemo_start.sh
  </pre>
  the script <b>$NEMO/docs/install_nemo.sh</b> has many options to set up some more advanced installations.
  
<LI> <b> I have an installation of nemo which, for some reason, I want
to re-compile with a version of gcc which is not in the standard 
path. How can I do this? Can I avoid re-installing nemo from
scratch?</b>
<br>
TBD

<H1> Programming NEMO </H1>
<OL>
<LI> <b> Compiling and adding a "standard" program </b>
<br>
<pre>
    % cd $NEMO/src/.....        (choose some reasonable place)
    % edit program.c
    % bake program          	(local build)
or
    % mknemo program        	(compiles and copies to $NEMOBIN)
</pre>
<LI> <b> Adding something new (but "standard") to the library </b>
<pre>
    % cd $NEMO/src/.....        (choose some reasonable place)
    % edit Makefile             (add the .o file to the object list)
    % make install              (compile and put in $NEMOLIB/libnemo.a)
</pre>
<LI>
</OL>

<pre>

Q:is there a noclobber option:
A:no, error=1 could help, but bad idea probably
</pre>

.TH BAKE 8NEMO "26 December 2019"
.SH NAME
bake \- making NEMO programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBbake \fIprogram)\fP 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIbake\fP tries to compile a program  using a
template Makefile (currently $NEMOLIB/Makefile.lib).
It will, much like \fImknemo(8NEMO)\fP simple NEMO programs, however
it will only do a local compile, and not place the binary
in $NEMOBIN.
.SH MAKEDEFS
The $NEMOLIB/Makefile.lib will depend on my system variables in the $NEMOLIB/makedefs file,
which in turn was generated by the \fIconfigure\fP step during the installation.
.PP
You can place a file named \fILocalMakedefs\fP in the currnt directory to override
the sytem \fImakedefs\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
mknemo(8NEMO)
.SH CAVEATS
The name \fIbake\fP was too easy to steal, so there are other programs with the same
name and goal, but obviously won't work in NEMO. We mention:
.nf
  https://www.corto.io/doc/bake.html   (uses json to generate code and build like make)
  https://esrlabs.github.io/bake/      (a ruby gem)
  https://github.com/SanderMertens/bake (mainly for C/C++ code)
.fi
If any of these are important to you, don't place $NEMO/s

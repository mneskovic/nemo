This is an example of a DEBIAN build specification.

control:        description + dependancies
preinst:        preinstall script, empty now
postinst:       postinstall script, will need to rewrite $NEMO=/opt/nemo_version, a kludge
mk_debian:      my example script to build a deb file

Note this is still fhard coded for version 4.2 and "all" architectures.  This would need to be 
changed for various debian/ubuntu/.... flavors, e.g 4.2-ubuntu18.04 for amd64
